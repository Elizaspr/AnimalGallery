<h4> Caring for a New Zealand Rabbit: </h4>
<p> <strong>SPACE:  </strong> As a fairly larger breed, they need more space then others. So expect to build a custom enclosure!  </p>

<p><strong> Health Issues: </strong> Like all rabbits they are prone to a few health issues like Obesity, Dental Issues, and Sore Hocks.   </p>

<p><strong> Food: </strong> Rabbits love to eat and need to forage constantly. They need Hay, Leafy Green Veggies, and Pellets that are given daily</p>
